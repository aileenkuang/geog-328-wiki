        <h1>Gentrification in the Chinatown-International District</h1>
        <p>
            Seattle's Chinatown-International District (aka Chinatown or the CID) -- a neighborhood
            that is largely populated by low-income, elderly Asian residents -- has been named one
            of the eleven most endangered historic areas in the United States by the National Trust
            for Historic Preservation (Clarridge). In recent years, there has been an influx of newer
            businesses and housing developments in the area -- for example, KODA Condominiums built a
            high-rise luxury apartment building in the neighborhood in 2020, with condo prices ranging
            from hundreds of thousands of dollars to 1.4 million (Tanabe).
