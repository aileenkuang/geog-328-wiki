        <h1>Gentrification in the Chinatown-International District</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Seattle's <strong>Chinatown-International District (aka Chinatown or the CID)</strong> -- a neighborhood
            that is largely populated by low-income, elderly Asian residents -- has been named one
            of the eleven most endangered historic areas in the United States by the National Trust
            for Historic Preservation (Clarridge). In recent years, there has been an influx of newer
            businesses and housing developments in the area -- for example, 
            <a href="https://www.ownkoda.com/">KODA Condominiums built a high-rise luxury apartment building in the neighborhood in 2020</a>,
            with condo prices ranging from hundreds of thousands of dollars to 1.4 million (Tanabe).
        </p>

        <p>
            The photos of what is now the Golden Hong Market below (taken from Google Maps) exemplify the 
            gentrification that has occured in the neighborhood in recent years. The first slide is from 
            2008, the next is from 2016, and the last is from 2021.

        <h2> Community Responses</h2>
        <p>
            Community members in the Chinatown-International District have resisted the gentrification
            and displacement occurring in their neighborhood. In 2019, the CID Coalition organized
            protests against a development planned for the site of Bush Garden, a Japanese restaurant and
            karaoke bar (Assunta). Furthermore, in 2022, residents protested against a light rail expansion
            project running through Chinatown that could displace at least 27 businesses (Reed).
